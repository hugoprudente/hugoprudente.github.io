            <div class="post-content">
                <p>During my career <code>coding</code> was always a strongly present on my roles, and this was always one of my strongest points. Back in the day knowing tools were a little bit more hard, what have caused some wheels to be reinvented like my own in-house Zabbix, master-agent monitoring tool that I even deployed to 500 machines around the whole country (Brazil).</p>
<p>My role was always to consolidate the infrastructure and application and make them work as healthy as possible with less effort as possible as for a really long time the team was &ldquo;me and myself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>During my journey I have learned, coded, and delivered projects the following programming languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>
<p>And on the last couple years on my actual job I have also included <code>Go</code> and <code>Rust</code> to my knowledge center and kept exercising some of the languages above.</p>
<p>The biggest problem on this is &ldquo;how to keep sharp&rdquo; on the languages when you need them or at least remember enough to not spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out how the basic things works again and I'm facing this now, getting back to <code>Java</code>.</p>
<p>My last official project with <code>java</code> was a really long time ago, and as I didn't had any solid project that would take advantage of the language, so <code>java</code> ended on a black hole.</p>
<p>The year changed and I decided to invest more time re-learn <code>java</code>, as it is heavily used by the company and this can give me more broad directions for short and long term on my career goals.</p>
<h3 id="but-how">But how?</h3>
<p>Yes that was the really problem! Organizing time and a routine that could keep me on track and do not jeopardize the other things that I need daily to keep sharp.</p>
<h3 id="100-days-of-code">100 Days Of Code!</h3>
<p>On twitter several of my followers joined the challenge to learn and study a new topic and I tough that it was a really good way to help me improve and create a routine, but I had faced another issue.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-do-every-day-to-100-days">What do I do every day to 100 days?</h3>
<p>Yeah, not everyone has projects and ideas that can work, even more if you have an strict contract, so everything needs to be really precise to not create chaos.</p>
<p>So 3 days ago I have created my own <a href="https://github.com/hugoprudente/100-days-of-code">repo</a> and was ready to start, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should I code?</li>
<li>How can I get back to the track?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-trick">The trick</h3>
<p>I have added 1 strict rule that is <strong>&ldquo;NO IDE&rdquo;</strong>, yes, the idea is to do <code>java</code> on vim reading the documentation as much as possible, over stack overflow.</p>
<p>As I'm really rust I'm getting all that I can from the following content providers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/"><a href="https://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/">https://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/</a></a></li>
<li><a href="https://exercism.io/my/tracks"><a href="https://exercism.io/my/tracks">https://exercism.io/my/tracks</a></a></li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/"><a href="https://leetcode.com/">https://leetcode.com/</a></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">https://www.hackerrank.com/</a></a></li>
</ul>
<p>So let's see how it goes! My first commit is up!</p>
<p>See you all later!</p>
