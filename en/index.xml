      <description>Several year ago, due to a code issue the application that I was working with wrote more than 10 millions files, exhausting all the inodes of the system. Due to that server not having replication at the time I went searching for the golden goose of the file deletion, and ended finding this.
Sadly the original article is not available anymore, but from that time now rsync is my mainly mass destruction tool!</description>

      <description>How hard is to you SysAdmin/DevOps to keep track of all the tools, platforms and frameworks available on the market?
3 years ago, Jeferson Norona #LinuxTips (VAI), posted on his personal page about a project responsible to gather all those tools and frameworks and consolidate it, to our life of SysAdmins/DevOps easier.
The project was created by Alen Krmelj and it&#39;s awesome!
