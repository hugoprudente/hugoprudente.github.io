      <description>During my career coding was always a strongly present on my roles, and this was always one of my strongest points. Back in the day knowing tools were a little bit more hard, what have caused some wheels to be reinvented like my own in-house Zabbix, master-agent monitoring tool that I even deployed to 500 machines around the whole country (Brazil).
My role was always to consolidate the infrastructure and application and make them work as healthy as possible with less effort as possible as for a really long time the team was &amp;ldquo;me and myself&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>How hard is to you SysAdmin/DevOps to keep track of all the tools, platforms and frameworks available on the market?
3 years ago, Jeferson Norona #LinuxTips (VAI), posted on his personal page about a project responsible to gather all those tools and frameworks and consolidate it, to our life of SysAdmins/DevOps easier.
The project was created by Alen Krmelj and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
